gIDE

[Description]

gIDE aims to be an unobtrusive IDE which allows the user to do what they want:
code without the IDE getting in their way.  To achive this gIDE is not tied to 
any particular language or build tools, but does allow the user to configure the 
build system on a per-project basis.

gIDE was designed to integrate nicely with the GNOME desktop enviroment and uses
many GTK and GNOME related technologies.
